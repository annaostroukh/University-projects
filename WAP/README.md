**Task - Form validation**

Create any form with entry fields. Implement JavaScript functions which allows to define the following limitations for entry fields:
1. Minimum/Maximum text length
2. Required data format written as a regular expression
3. Required/Non-required field

On each field can be applied any combinations of listed above limitations. Form has to dynamically show whether the field is filled correctly (correct - green, incorrect - red). A button for form sending has to be shown as disabled until all fields are filled correctly.
